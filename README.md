These are the 3 ways to sum n. Recursive, For Loop and Summation formula. 

Time Complexity for recursive function is O(n). It perform recusrive calls that is dependent on size of n. 

Time Complexity for For Loop is O(n). Similarly, iterates over each number form 0 to n, but it is more efficint compared to resusive approach.

Time Complexity for summation formula is O(1). It directly computes the sum using formula, does not depend on the size of n
